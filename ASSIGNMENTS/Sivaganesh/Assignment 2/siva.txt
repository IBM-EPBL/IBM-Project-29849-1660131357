"Designing News Page"

We’re going to design the news page using Bootstrap only. So, create a news.html file inside the templates directory and add the following code there:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
      integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    />
    <title>Latest News Headlines</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="text-center mt-4 mb-5">Latest News Headlines</h1>
    <div class="row mt-5">
      <div class="col-md-2"></div>
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <div class="row">
          {% for news in news_articles %}
          <div class="col-md-4 mb-5">
            <div class="card" style="width: 18rem">
              <img src="{{ news.urlToImage }}" class="card-img-top" alt="..." />
              <div class="card-body">
                <h5 class="card-title">{{ news.title }}</h5>
                <p class="card-text">{{ news.description }}</p>
                <a href="{{ news.url }}" class="btn btn-primary">Read More</a>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          {% endfor %}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-2"></div>
    </div>
    <!-- Bootstrap Bundle with Popper -->
    <script
      src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
      integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    ></script>
  </body>
</html>

"Creating Route for News page"

Now, open the routes.py file and create a route "/news" for the news page.

from core import app
from flask import render_template
from .utils import get_latest_news   # Add this line
@app.route('/')
def say_hello():
    user = {"name": "Ashutosh"}
    return render_template("index.html", user=user)
# Add this part
@app.route('/news')
def news_headlines():
    news_articles = get_latest_news()
    return render_template("news.html", news_articles=news_articles)

Now we are ready to run the server and see the output:



Doesn’t that look amazing? We just created our first news application using Flask.
